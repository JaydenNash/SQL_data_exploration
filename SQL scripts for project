--first i select the tables i want to compare


Select *
From portfolioProject1..lebroncareer

Select *
From portfolioProject1..jordan


----now i am selecting all fg attempts.

Select date, fg, fga
From portfolioProject1..lebroncareer

Select date, fg, fga
From portfolioProject1..jordan


-- next do the exact same thing but just for three point shots three point shots

Select date, three, threeatt
From portfolioProject1..lebroncareer

Select date, three, threeatt
From portfolioProject1..jordan

-- lets find the total amount of games they each played in this dataset.
  
SELECT COUNT(date) AS amount_OF_games
FROM portfolioProject1..lebroncareer

SELECT COUNT(date) AS amount_OF_games
FROM portfolioProject1..jordan




--  DATA VISUALIZATION #1 - next lets find the average total FG percentage and not include any games where no shots were taken to avoid dividing by zero

SELECT player, SUM(fga) AS total_attempted, SUM(fg) AS total_made, AVG(CASE WHEN fga = 0 THEN NULL ELSE fg / fga END) * 100 AS average_fg_percent
FROM (
    SELECT 'LeBron' AS player, fga, fg
    FROM portfolioProject1..lebroncareer
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Jordan' AS player, fga, fg
    FROM portfolioProject1..jordan
) AS subquery
GROUP BY player;

-- DATA VISUALIZATION #2 for a more specific analysis of their shooting lets see how many games each player made UNDER AND OVER 50% shooting meaning they missed more than they scored Using the CASE and WHEN  and COUNT function .


SELECT player,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN fg / fga < 0.50 THEN 1 END) AS games_under_fifty,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN fg / fga > 0.50 AND fga > 0 THEN 1 END) AS games_over_fifty
FROM (
    SELECT 'LeBron' AS player, fg, fga
    FROM portfolioProject1..lebroncareer
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Jordan' AS player, fg, fga
    FROM portfolioProject1..jordan
) AS combined_stats
GROUP BY player;


--DATA VISUALIZATION #3 next lets find the average  shooting percentage and how much they shot. and account to not include any games where 0 shots were taken 

SELECT player, SUM(threeatt) AS total_attempted, SUM(three) AS total_made, AVG(CASE WHEN threeatt = 0 THEN NULL ELSE three / threeatt END) * 100 AS average_three_percent -- the sum and avg functions calculate for each collumn.
FROM (
    SELECT 'LeBron' AS player, threeatt, three
    FROM portfolioProject1..lebroncareer
    UNION all
    SELECT 'Jordan' AS player, threeatt, three
    FROM portfolioProject1..jordan
) AS subquery
GROUP BY player;


-- DATA VISUALIZATION #4 lets see how many games they shot less than thirty percent and there are times where there is no three point attempt so to avoid dividing by zero we add anoither CASE to account for the zero.
  
SELECT player,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN CASE WHEN threeatt = 0 THEN 0 ELSE three / threeatt END < 0.30 THEN 1 END) AS games_under_thirty,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN CASE WHEN threeatt = 0 THEN 0 ELSE three / threeatt END > 0.30 AND threeatt > 0 THEN 1 END) AS games_over_thirty
FROM (
    SELECT 'LeBron' AS player, three, threeatt
    FROM portfolioProject1..lebroncareer
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Jordan' AS player, three, threeatt
    FROM portfolioProject1..jordan
) AS combined_stats
GROUP BY player;
